We may share aggregated demographic information, not linked to personally identifiable information, about our visitors and users with our business partners, affiliates and advertisers for the purposes mentioned above. We may also use third-party service providers to help us manage our business operations and the Web site, or to administer activities on our behalf, such as sending newsletters or conducting surveys.
